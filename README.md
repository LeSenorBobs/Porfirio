# haxe-openfl-examples
A collections of very basic examples in Haxe and OpenFL

* CelularAutomataMap: Map generation with Cellular automata (click the stage to step the algorithm)
* FontDisplay: Demo of how to show 'special' fonts in Flash and Neko
* KeyboardEvent_01: A very minimalistic example for registering keypresses (run it and press a key to see it work)
* MoveToFront: How to move one element in front of all others. For example when you click on it.
* StaticVariables: A small demo on how to create your own static variables.
* StringInterpolation: An example on how to combine variables into Strings (make sure you see the debug output)
* TimeBasedAnimation: Simple example of making something move based on time instead of frames
* URLLoader: How to load data (HTML, JSON, XML) from a remote URL
