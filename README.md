# haxe-openfl-examples
A collections of very basic examples in Haxe and OpenFL

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/manno-xx/haxe-openfl-examples/wiki) for a loose categorization as well as the occasional explanation with the examples.
(all diagrams in the wiki are done with [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/))

* Actuate: Demonstrates the Actuate tweening engine. Tweening engines are mainly used for animation (movement, rotation etc.) but can do more. This demonstrates just the basics.
* ArrayExampleOne: Using an array as a source of information. The application flicks through the items in the array until it is empty.
* CelularAutomataMap: Map generation with Cellular automata (click the stage to step the algorithm).
* CollisionDetectionAABB: Demo of the basic collision detection using OpenFL's hitTestObject() and a variation that allows for more control. (AABB = Axis Aligned Bounding Box).
* EditableTextOpenFL: Demo of how to make an editable text field.
* FontDisplay: Demo of how to show 'special' fonts in Flash and Neko.
* Grids: Examples of how to build a basic grid of items (lovely magenta rects in this case).
* KeyboardEvent_01: A very minimalistic example for registering keypresses (run it and press a key to see it work).
* KeyboardMovement: The very basics of making something move based on keyboard events.
* KeyboardMovement_02: Movement based on keyboard events and a velocity vector.
* KeyboardMovement_03: Demo of better Keyboard controlled avatars with only _one_ class to do the registration of which keys are pressed. Each avatar has its own key set it responds to
* MoveToFront: How to move one element in front of all others. For example when you click on it.
* PlaySound: Simple demo of how to play a sound file with pause functionality.
* ScreenSwitcher: A demo to display screens defined in seperate classes. Uses enums and a kinda singleton pattern.
* SingletonDemo: Demonstrates the use of the Singleton design pattern.
* SpriteAnimation: Use of the Tilesheet example to play sprite sheet animations independent from application framerate.
* StateMachine: Demonstrates the State pattern.
* StaticVariables: A small demo on how to create and use your own static variables (opposed to the unavoidable Event.ENTER_FRAME, Keyboard.UP, etc.).
* StringInterpolation: An example on how to combine variables into Strings (make sure you see the debug output).
* TimeBasedAnimation: Simple example of making something move based on time instead of frames.
* UIProgressBar: Example of a bar indicating progress of some sort.
* URLLoader: How to load data (HTML, JSON, XML) from a remote URL.
