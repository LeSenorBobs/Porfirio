# haxe-openfl-examples
A collections of very basic examples in Haxe and OpenFL

* Actuate: Demonstrates the Actuate tweening engine. Tweening engines are mainly used for animation (movement, rotation etc.) but can do more. This demonstrates just the basics.
* CelularAutomataMap: Map generation with Cellular automata (click the stage to step the algorithm)
* CollisionDetectionAABB: Demo of the basic collision detection using OpenFL's hitTestObject() and a variation that allows for more control. (AABB = Axis Aligned Bounding Box)
* FontDisplay: Demo of how to show 'special' fonts in Flash and Neko
* KeyboardEvent_01: A very minimalistic example for registering keypresses (run it and press a key to see it work)
* MoveToFront: How to move one element in front of all others. For example when you click on it.
* SingletonDemo: Demonstrates the use of the Singleton design pattern.
* StaticVariables: A small demo on how to create and use your own static variables (opposed to the unavoidable Event.ENTER_FRAME, Keyboard.UP, etc.).
* StringInterpolation: An example on how to combine variables into Strings (make sure you see the debug output)
* TimeBasedAnimation: Simple example of making something move based on time instead of frames
* UIProgressBar: Example of a bar indicating progress of some sort.
* URLLoader: How to load data (HTML, JSON, XML) from a remote URL
